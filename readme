	The bid script (build in docker) is a system for building C/C++ projects for Linux, the main idea of which is to build inside pre-configured Docker containers to solve the portability problem. The system allows you to create a build space, create new projects, set dependencies between projects, manage projects within the build space, configure and package redistributable packages, and unpack a configured build space with ready-made projects from a redistributable package.
    
	The build system supports the following commands:
		build - to run the build and install the project into the current build space
		clear - to uninstall the assembled project and clean it to the state of the source files
		create - to initialize a new project
		delete - to completely remove the project from the current build space
		init - to initialize a new build space
		manage - for project management
		pack - for creating portable packages
		unpack - to initialize a configured build space with ready-made projects from the redistributable package
		setenv - to set the path to libraries to an environment variable
		help - to demonstrate this help information
	To view help for each of the above commands, type ./bid help [COMMAND]
